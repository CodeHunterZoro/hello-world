Hello Everyone!

My name is Jay Cash!  I am fairly new to programming at this point, and so far I am having a blast with it!
I love learning and developing my skills, and eventually I hope to make this my full-time career!
Besides programming I also enjoy teaching myself foreign languages...
So far I am multilingual, knowing English, Spanish, Russian, and Japanese!
